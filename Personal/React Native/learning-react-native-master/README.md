# learning-react-native

Code samples for the book _Learning React Native_. You can get the book from [Amazon](http://bit.ly/lrnamaff) or [O'Reilly](http://bit.ly/learningreactnative)!

## Versions

[Release 0.0.1](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native/releases/tag/0.0.1) is the version published in the printed book (first edition). The versions of React Native used in each project vary; most use React Native `0.11.x`.

[Release 1.0.0](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native/releases/tag/1.0.0) is the next version, updated to use React Native version `0.26.3`. This version also uses more ES2015-style JavaScript idioms, when appropriate; most notably consistent ES6-style classes and module definitions. The `PlatformSpecific` project remains at version `0.0.1`, due to the example's incompatibility with React Native `0.26.3`.
